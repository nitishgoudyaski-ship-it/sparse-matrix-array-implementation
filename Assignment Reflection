How long did you spend on this assignment?
I spent approximately 2â€“3 hours on this project, reading about sparse matrix representation, coding, and testing with different inputs.

On your work, if you were marking yourself, what grade letter would you give yourself?
I would give myself an A, as I read about the topic in depth, coded cleanly, and tested different cases.

Based on your solution, what letter grade would you assign yourself?
I believe I received an A, since the program compiles, runs correctly, and displays both the triplet form and the entire matrix expansion.

Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, and include an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you felt like you struggled.
My solution is effective for small and medium-sized matrices but not necessarily optimized for very big sparse matrices.
For instance, printing the entire matrix also involves iterating over each row and column, which hampers efficiency if the matrix happens to be very large.
I also did not apply addition or multiplication of sparse matrices, something that might be an extension of this project.
It was difficult initially to store the triplet data in an organized way, but using a struct and a vector made it all easier.

How long did you spend on this assignment?  
I spent about 2â€“3 hours working on this assignment, including reading about sparse matrix representations, writing the code, and testing it with different inputs.  

Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?  
I would give myself an A, because I carefully studied the topic, wrote clean code, and tested multiple cases.  

Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?  
I believe I earned an A, since the program compiles, runs correctly, and demonstrates both the triplet representation and the full matrix expansion.  

Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.  
My solution works for small and medium-sized matrices, but it is not optimized for very large sparse matrices. 
For example, displaying the full matrix still requires iterating through every row and column, which reduces efficiency if the matrix is extremely large. 
I also did not implement addition or multiplication of sparse matrices, which could be an extension of this project. 
I initially struggled with storing the triplet data in a clean way, but using a `struct` with a vector made the implementation much simpler.
